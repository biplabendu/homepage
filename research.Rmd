## Behavioral plasticity and clocks

Animals exhibit daily rhythms in physiology and behavior, anticipating predictable fluctuations in their environment. Behavioral rhythms are “flexible” since the phase, amplitude, and period can change throughout an animal’s life. 

>_I study how the biological clock regulates behavioral plasticity in social organisms._

While clock-controlled behavioral plasticity is crucial to a species’ survival and fitness, it has also been hypothesized to be a conserved target for several manipulative parasites that induce timely changes to host behavior in order to maximize growth and transmission.

During my Phd, I studied the Florida carpenter ant *Camponotus floridanus*, and its specialized _Ophiocordyceps_ fungi, to explore questions at the intersection of sociobiology, chronobiology, and parasitology by combining controlled behavioral experiments with time-course transcriptomics.
