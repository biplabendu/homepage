### Bio ([CV](cv.html))   
    
I am a doctoral candidate working at the intersection of chronobiology, animal behavior, and infectious diseases alongside [Dr. Charissa de Bekker](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/debekkerlab/). We are currently based out of the [Department of Biology](http://sciences.ucf.edu/biology/) and are part of the [Genomics and Bioinformatics Cluster](https://www.ucf.edu/research/genomics-bioinformatics/) at the University of Central Florida.

Synopsis of my dissertation research:
Animals often exhibit daily rhythms in behavior as a way to anticipate predictable fluctuations in their environment with regards to the presence and absence of abiotic (e.g., light, temperature) and biotic (e.g., food, predators) factors. Such daily rhythmicity is the phenotypic result of genes and proteins that are under control of endogenous biological clocks. Behavioral rhythms are “flexible” since their phase, amplitude, and period can change throughout an animal’s life hallmarked by changes in so-called chronotype. This demonstrates that there is a certain plasticity present in clock-controlled behaviors. As such, characterizing the properties of rhythmic behavior and their underlying molecular mechanisms can further our understanding of the inherent plasticity in animal behavior and the major pathways involved. 

While clock-controlled behavioral plasticity is crucial to a species’ survival and fitness, it has also been hypothesized to be a conserved target for several manipulative parasites that induce timely changes to host behavior in order to maximize growth and transmission. Using the Florida carpenter ant *Camponotus floridanus* as a model, Dr. de Bekker and I intend to bridge some of the existing knowledge gaps between sociobiology, chronobiology and parasitology by combining controlled behavioral experiments with time-course transcriptomics. First, we propose to identify the candidate molecular mechanisms that could be enabling these highly social animals to possess plasticity in their internal timekeeping. Subsequently, we aim to test the hypothesis that such chronobiological plasticity, at the level of gene expression and behavior, can be manipulated by fungal parasites that require timely changes in host behavior in order to complete their life cycle.
