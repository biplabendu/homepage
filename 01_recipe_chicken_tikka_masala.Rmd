# STEP BY STEP

___

## Step 1: Marinate chicken

> If vegetarian, fry some Paneer or Tofu lightly coated in the **magic masala**, and keep aside.

### Ingredients for marinade:

- 28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 cup plain yogurt
- 1.5 tablespoons garlic (4-6 cloves; minced/paste)
- 1 tablespoon ginger (1-1.5 inch; minced/paste)
- 5 tsp **Magic Masala**
- 1 teaspoon of salt

In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the marinade; let marinate for 10 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows).

___

## Step 2: Fry marinated chicken

- 2.1 | Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.

- 2.2 | When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches, making sure not to crowd the pan.

- 2.3 | Fry until browned, approximately 3-5 minutes on each side.

- 2.4 | Set aside, remove and save browned bits stuck to the pan.

- 2.5 | Repeat steps 2.1 to 2.4.

## Step 3: Make sauce

> *Finely dicing onions and tomatoes are recommended for a smooth-ish texture of the sauce.*

### Prep and keep ready

- 1 large onion (red preferred) - finely diced
- 14 oz (400 g) tomato - pureed or finely diced
- 1.5 tablespoons garlic (4-6 cloves; minced/paste)
- 1.5 tablespoon ginger (1.5 inch; minced/paste)

### Other ingredients

- 2 tbsp Butter
- 5 tsp **Magic Masala**
- 1 cup heavy cream or half-n-half
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt

### Step-by-Step

- 3.1 | Melt 2 tbsp butter in the same pan (if possible) in which chicken was shallow fried.

- 3.2 | Fry onions until soft and translucent, while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan. 

- 3.3 | Add 1.5 tbsp garlic and ginger paste, each, and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant.

- 3.4 | Add 5 tsp **Magic Masala**; fry for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

- 3.5 | Add tomatoes and 1 tsp salt; cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes on low-medium heat, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

- 3.6 | [Optional] Stir 1 cup heavy cream (half and half works as well) and 1 tsp sugar through the sauce.

- 3.7 | Add chicken (or paneer/tofu) and burned bits back into the pan; mix well and cook for an additional 10-15 minutes at low-medium heat until chicken is cooked and the sauce is thick and bubbling. Stir occasionally (~5 mins).

- 3.8 | Pour in 0.5 cup of water to thin out the sauce. Add more water if needed (adjust consistency to your liking).

- 3.9 | Taste sauce, and adjust salt/sugar if needed. That's it; now, enjoy with rice/naan/tortilla and cucumbers :)
